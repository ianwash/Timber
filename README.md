# Timber
## Overview 
Every other month, I need to give my playlists a trim. Otherwise, they will get uncontrollably long. Removing this clutter makes room for me to discover new music, while also focusing on the songs I still enjoy. However, migrating to a new playlist was always a chore given the multiple buttons needed to add a song. Therefore, I decided to create Timber.

Timber allows users to log into their Spotify account and select a playlist. The user will then swipe left on songs they wish to delete, and right on songs they wish to keep. Similar to another cool app called Tinder! The user's right swipes will then be created into either a new playlist or tacked onto an existing one based off their preferences. They can also edit their playlist directly if they wish!

Some cool additional features include real-time playback and the ability to access playlists of friends :)
